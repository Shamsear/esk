# Performance Optimizations Guide

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the website to ensure fast loading and smooth execution across all device types.

## Core Web Vitals Optimizations

The following optimizations target Core Web Vitals metrics:

### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Critical CSS inlined in the head
- Preloading of key resources like the logo
- Deferred loading of non-critical CSS
- Compressed and optimized images
- Server-side caching via .htaccess

### First Input Delay (FID)
- JavaScript execution deferred where possible
- Heavy animations only initiated after page load
- Reduced JavaScript bundle size
- Throttled event handlers

### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Images with explicit width and height attributes
- Content placeholders during loading
- Webfonts with `display=swap`
- Skeleton loading states

## Device-Specific Optimizations

### Low-End Devices
- Detection of device capabilities
- Reduced or disabled animations
- Lower quality images and videos
- Hidden particle effects
- Simplified gradients and shadows

### Mobile Optimization
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Optimized for low bandwidth and data saving
- Reduced motion for mobile devices

### High-End Devices
- Progressive enhancement with advanced visual effects
- Full-quality images and videos
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Network Optimizations

- Service Worker for offline access
- Cache API usage for assets
- Progressive Web App (PWA) implementation
- HTTP/2 Push support
- Preloading and prefetching of resources
- CDN recommendations for static assets

## Browser Compatibility

The optimizations are designed to work across all modern browsers with graceful degradation for older browsers:

- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge: Full support
- IE 11: Basic functionality with reduced features
- Legacy browsers: Functional but without animations

## PWA Features

- Installable on supported devices
- Offline functionality
- App-like experience
- Push notifications (where implemented)

## Development Guidelines

When making changes to the codebase, follow these performance guidelines:

1. **Always test on low-end devices** - Use throttling in devtools
2. **Measure before and after changes** - Use Lighthouse and WebPageTest
3. **Optimize images** - Use WebP with JPEG/PNG fallbacks
4. **Minimize third-party scripts** - Each adds performance cost
5. **Lazy load below-the-fold content** - Only load what's needed

## Scripts Usage

The project includes several optimization scripts:

- `compress-assets.js`: Image optimization tool
- `service-worker.js`: Service worker implementation
- `performance.js`: Runtime performance optimizations
- `image-optimization.js`: Responsive image handling

## Monitoring

Regularly check performance using:

- Google PageSpeed Insights
- Chrome DevTools Performance panel
- Core Web Vitals report in Google Search Console
- Real User Monitoring (RUM) if implemented

## Caching Strategy

The service worker implements different caching strategies:

- **Cache First, Network Fallback**: For static assets
- **Network First, Cache Fallback**: For dynamic content
- **Stale While Revalidate**: For content that updates periodically

## Future Improvements

Areas for potential future optimization:

- Implement HTTP/3 when widely supported
- Add image CDN with automatic optimization
- Consider server-side rendering for dynamic content
- Explore module/nomodule pattern for modern/legacy JavaScript
- Implement resource hints more aggressively
- Consider Signed HTTP Exchanges for prefetching
